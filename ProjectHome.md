ROS-Industrial is a BSD-licensed ROS stack that contains libraries, tools and drivers for industrial hardware. The goals of ROS-Industrial are to:
  * Create a community supported by industrial robotics researchers and professionals
  * Provide a one-stop location for industry-related ROS applications
  * Develop robust and reliable software that meets the needs of industrial applications
  * Combine the relative strengths of ROS with existing industrial technologies (i.e. combining ROS high-level functionality with the low-level reliability and safety of industrial robot controllers).
  * Create standard interfaces to stimulate “hardware-agnostic” software development (using standardized ROS messages)
  * Provide an easy path to apply cutting-edge research in industrial applications, using a common ROS architecture
  * Provide simple, easy-to-use, well-documented APIs

**For more information go to the ROS-Industrial [main site](http://www.ros.org/wiki/Industrial)**.

We’d like to invite others to use this software and contribute new applications and interfaces, particularly ROS drivers for different industrial robot platforms.  If you are interested in integrating a new platform or otherwise contributing to ROS-Industrial, please send an email to [ROS-Industrial Developers Group](mailto:swri-ros-pkg-dev@googlegroups.com)
